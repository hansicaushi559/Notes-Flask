# Notes-Flask

This  project is a web application built using Flask as the web framework and Sql. The project implements a user authentication system using sessions to set cookies, which allows users to create an account and login with it.
Once authenticated, users can create and delete notes associated with their account. The application is designed to prevent unauthorized access to notes by ensuring that notes created by one user cannot be seen by another user who logs in with a different account.
